run_RL_shadowlite.py
====================
ROS node that runs a pre-trained RL policy on the Shadow Hand Lite.
 
Task   : Peace sign gesture
Robot  : Shadow Hand Lite (13 actuated controllers)
Policy : GaussianPolicy trained in IsaacLab with 13 actions
 
Key facts about the hardware:
  - /joint_states publishes 16 joints (includes J1 which mirrors J2 physically)
  - Only 13 ROS position controllers exist (ffj0 controls FFJ1+FFJ2 together)
  - Policy was trained with FFJ2/MFJ2/RFJ2 as the controlling joint (J1 mimics J2)
  - Scale mismatch: policy outputs 0 to pi/2 per coupled joint,
    but real J0 range is 0 to pi → multiply by 2.0 when publishing
